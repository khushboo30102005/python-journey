### Question-1. What are data types in python? List any four with Example.

### answer:

#### DataTypes in python are a way to classify data items, they represent the kind of value, which determine what operation can be performed on data.

     example:
     1. Numeric => int, float
     2. Sequence => string, tuple, list
     3. Mapping => dict
     4. Boolean => bool


### Question-2. What is deference between explicit and implicit type conversion? Give One example.

### answer:

#### Type Casting : Type casting is method to convert python variable into certain data type in order to perform the required operation by users. There can be two types of typecasting.

#### Implicit type conversion: In this conversion `python` converts data types into another data types automatically.

```python
   a = 5
   print(type(a))   # <class 'int'>
```

#### Explicit Conversion: In this method python needs user's involvement to convert variable data type into require data type.
```python
   a = int("5")
   print(type(a))   # <class 'int'>
```

### Question-3. What are Operator in python? Explain any three with Example.
### Answer:
#### In Python programming, Operators are used to perform operations on values or variables.
     Operators : Special symbol like : +,-,*,/,%
     Operands : Values on which operators are applied.
     
     1. Arithmetic Operators
        +,-,*,/,%,**
      
     2.Comparison Operators 
       ==, >=, <=, !=, <, >

     3. Logical Operators
       and, or, not
